### Project: Location-Based Service API

#### 1. **Initial Setup (1 hour)**

- **Environment Setup:** Create a Python virtual environment and install FastAPI, Uvicorn (for serving the app), and
  PyMongo.
- **Project Structure:** Initialize the project structure with directories for models, routes, services, and utilities.

#### 2. **MongoDB Configuration (1 hour)**

- **Database Initialization:** Set up a MongoDB database.
- **Geo-Spatial Indexing:** Understand and create geo-spatial indexes for efficient querying.
- **Collections Setup:** Create collections for `Locations` with fields like `name`, `coordinates` (longitude,
  latitude), and `category`.

#### 3. **API Development (4 hours)**

- **POI Management:**
    - **CRUD Operations:** Develop endpoints to add, update, view, and delete POIs.
    - **Schema Design:** Use Pydantic models for input validation and data serialization.
- **Location Querying:**
    - **Nearby Search:** Implement an endpoint to find POIs within a specified radius of the user's current location.
    - **Filtering:** Allow filtering POIs by category, ratings, etc.

#### 4. **User Location Tracking (2 hours)**

- **Endpoint for Location Update:** Create an endpoint for users to update their current location.
- **History Management:** Store and retrieve a user's location history.

#### 5. **Advanced Features (2 hours)**

- **Recommendations:** Develop a simple recommendation algorithm based on user preferences or history.
- **Geo-fencing:** Implement basic geo-fencing functionalities, like sending alerts when a user enters a specific area.

#### 6. **Testing and Validation (2 hours)**

- **Unit Testing:** Write tests for all endpoints, focusing on edge cases for geo-spatial data.
- **Data Validation:** Ensure robust input validation for geo-coordinates and other data.

#### 7. **Documentation and Final Touches (1 hour)**

- **API Documentation:** Document the API using FastAPI's Swagger UI.
- **Code Review:** Refactor and clean up the code, ensuring it adheres to best practices.

#### 8. **Performance Optimization (1 hour)**

- **Query Optimization:** Analyze and optimize geo-spatial queries.
- **Indexing Review:** Ensure that MongoDB indexes are properly set up for optimal performance.

#### 9. **Stretch Goals (Optional)**

- **User Interface:** If time allows, create a basic frontend to interact with the API (e.g., a map view to display
  POIs).
- **Real-Time Updates:** Explore WebSocket integration for real-time location updates.

### Completion Criteria:

- The API should be able to handle CRUD operations for POIs.
- Efficient querying of nearby POIs based on user location.
- Basic user location tracking and history management.
- Proper documentation and testing of the API.
